**REGARDING EMBEDS** 
embed.html will be the actively-tested embed script

NEED REGISTRATION
Registration and login may be able to be their own separate embed script: loggin in will basically just provide a token associated to the user so won't need active logic for the posting and commenting


at the moment(in conjunction with a locally-running backend), login works, but does not persist (cookie issues, may need to use local storage instead)

posts and comments not really tested.
