## More robust backend forms
- add more validations and necessary error messages(esp. max length: ppl don't need to be posting long titles or books for post content)

### Build and test user registration/login for Squarespace app
- facebook / apple login needs to be added
### Are topics a predefined list? What are they?
- Uncertan of how to handle topic: I would assume a predefined list would be good to keep things from getting out of hand
### Build and test gallery of posts
- There are currently some test blocks in the forum page of the Squarespace site, seems easy enough to achieve the current wireframe(9/18/23)
### Build and test a single post view with comments 
- The posts need to 'redirect', or more likely re-render the page with the post and its associated comments, as well as a form for posting a new comment

### Admin Email setup for backend stuff(currently on Ethan's personal accounts)
